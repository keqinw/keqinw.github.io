We developed a new parallel robot and based on it, we designed an intelligent gripping system for disordered parts on the assembly line, making the process of gripping parts easy and efficient.  

The above figure shows the machine we built, which contains the following hardware modules: frame, parallel robot (internal DC power supply, MKS SBASE microcontroller, etc.), end gripper, conveyor belt, USB camera, LCD display, and some necessary auxiliary components and the host computer Raspberry Pi.
